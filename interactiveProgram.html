	<p>This project follows the below pipeline.</p>

	<img src="pipeline.png" alt="">

	<p>I have broken this project into to major portions. The first portion calculates the hits (weak and strong transcription factor binding sights) for a specified chromosome and transcription factor. The second portion analyses these hits. Let's talk about these two portions more in depth.</p>

	<h2>Part 1: Finding the Hits</h2>

	<p>To calculate the hits, I read in from a file called input.txt which is formatted as follows:</p>
	
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr><th>Line Number</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr><td>1</td><td>Name of fasta file</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>2</td><td>Name of tamo file</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>3</td><td>Weak threshold value</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>4</td><td>Strong threshold value</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>5</td><td>Size of each category of distances between sites</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>6</td><td>Maximum allowed plus/minus distance between a strong and weak site</td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

I had originally sought out to do this project in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com), but with the fact that we're running our code with super big data (and for the sake of your and my sanity), I have decided to use [Python](https://www.python.org), with [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org), for this project. I read in the chromosomes from a fasta file called $\texttt{SGDv3.fasta}$ and the associated PSSM to the transcription factor from the tamo file called $\texttt{yeast.tamo}$. Before we continue, let's first read in $\texttt{input.txt}$.
