# Instructions

First off, you'll want to clone my repository using the command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnLetey/A-Study-of-Transcription-and-Its-Affects.git
```

After that, if you don't already have Jupyter Notebook installed, I suggest doing the following instructions

## Jupyter Notebook Installation

- Install Anaconda from the this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (please download the Python 3 version).
- Depending on which system you're on, Anaconda might have you answer some questions.
- When you're done installing, open Anaconda Navigator. Click the launch button under the box saying Jupyter Notebook.
- This should open up Jupyter Notebook in your default browser.
