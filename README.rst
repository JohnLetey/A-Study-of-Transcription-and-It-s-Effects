A Study of Transcription and Its Affects
========================================

**Contributors:** John Letey (John.Letey@colorado.edu) and David Knox (David.Knox@colorado.edu)

**Warnings:** My Python code takes a long time to run. I'd suggest looking at the output of my program and not running my code to get the output.

**Notes:** To get to my GitHub repository, go to this `website <https://github.com/JohnLetey/A-Study-of-Transcription-and-Its-Affects>`_. For instructions on how to use my repository, go `here <https://github.com/JohnLetey/A-Study-of-Transcription-and-Its-Affects/blob/master/instructions.md>`_.

**Dependencies:** Please checkout my ``package.json`` file, or this `page <https://github.com/JohnLetey/A-Study-of-Transcription-and-Its-Affects/network/dependencies>`_... both contain the dependencies.

The below figure is the pipeline which I implemented in this project:

I have broken this project into to two major portions. The first portion calculates the hits (weak and strong transcription factor binding sights) for a specified chromosome (or all of the chromosomes) and transcription factor. The second portion analyses these hits. Let's jump right in.
