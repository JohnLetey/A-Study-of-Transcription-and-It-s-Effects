**Installing Dependencies**

1. Install Python 3
2. Install requirements:
```sh
~ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**Running code on my data (this is still a work in progress)**

To easily run code on my data, simply run this command:

```sh
~ bash run.sh
```

But, to get a more interactive and visual experience, run the following command:
    
```sh
~ python3 run_server.py
```
    
Then, open up `localhost:9000` in your favorite browser.

**Running on your own data**
