The script `main.m` is broken up into two major parts. Please note that hits are strong and weak binding sites.

## Part 1 : Finding the Hits
The script that finds the hits, which is called from `main.m`, is called `hits.m`.  

## Part 2 : Analysing the Hits
The script that analyses the hits, which is called from `main.m`, is called `distances.m`. `distances.m` calculates the distances between every weak and strong site.
